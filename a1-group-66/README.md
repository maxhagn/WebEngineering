# Assignment 1: HTML & CSS

You are tasked with building the website for __Artmart__, a web shop for fine art prints.

In this first assignment, you will implement the responsive design of the Artmart website using HTML and CSS. You need to follow the [Artmart Design Guide][design_guide], which you can find on TUWEL.

You should build the website inside the `www` folder. It already contains some HTML and CSS fragments for you to use as a starting points, as well as various graphical assets used throughout the site.

In the `test` folder you will find a test script with which you can measure your progress.
It will generate a detailed test report and tell you your current point total for this assignment.

## What you need to do

- Familiarize yourself with the [Artmart Design Guide][design_guide] and the [Artmart Design Mockups][design_mockups], both of which you will find in the TUWEL course for this lecture.

- Check out the `www` folder. Parts of the website are already implemented, but might not be quite finished. Take a look at what's there and figure out what remains to be done.

- The `met-objects` folder contains images and metadata for the sample artworks you should use in this exercise. Look at `objects.json` and extract the information necessary to match the site as it appears in the design guide and the visual tests.

- Take a look at the `test` folder and find out how to determine your points.

- Note that the design guide may at times be ambiguous or leave some gaps in the specification. You might have to make some judgement calls. Let the tests be your guide. If the tests are at odds with the design guide, the tests are right.

- If something is not covered by the tests, *but specified in the assignment* (in this case, the design guide), then we expect you to implement it. We might test for it after you hand your assignment in.

- This assignment is about building a static website using only HTML & CSS. Do not use JavaScript, which will be covered in the next assignment.

- You are not required to take backwards-compatibility into account. You can code against the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox and Safari. You *will* need to ensure cross-browser and cross-platform compatibility, but within reason.

- As this is a group exercise, we expect all team members to contribute in roughly equal amounts. The git history reflects each team member's individual contributions, so keep that in mind.
